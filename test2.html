      Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump on Wednesday got behind a bill to drastically cut legal immigration and replace current employment based visas with a point system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan mimics systems used by Australia and Canada, which Trump has often praised, in awarding points to potential immigrants based on broad categories. <br/>The 140,000 visas available annually under this system would be distributed to the highest point-getters first
